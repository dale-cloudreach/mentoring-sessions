# Variables

As in any other programming language, you can use variables in Bash Scripting as well.

There are no data types, for example string, integer, boolean, etc.

A variable in Bash can contain numbers as well as characters.

To assign a value to a variable, all you need to do is use the = sign:

```
name="Dale"
```

You can not have spaces before and after the = sign.

Use the variable with the $ sign:

```
echo $name
```

## Task 1:
Create a Bash script that contains a variable that stores your name and use echo to output the value.

## Task 2: 
Try adding two variables to the script, for example your name and a greeting, and use the variables in a single echo output.

So far we've used static variables, let's try asking the user for input.
