# :notebook_with_decorative_cover: Template for Mentoring Sessions
- A template repository to use in Cloudreach mentoring sessions.
- These sessions are created based on topics picked from the [DevOps roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/devops).
- Each topic should take roughly 45-60 minutes to work through, perfect for 1 hour weekly mentoring sessions.

> Tip: Use the Visual Studio Code Live Sharing extension during mentoring sessions. Very useful way to pair program remotely.
